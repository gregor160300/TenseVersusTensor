But the greatest of all these things listed above will have been the lack of trust. Just imagine a relationship based on lies, deceit, and dishonesty, sounds disgusting right? That\u2019s how it is when you haven\u2019t built trust in your partner.\n\nThe happiest, most satisfying relationships will have rested on a foundation of implicit trust. If you want your relationship to be all it can be, both of you will have learned how to create this kind of trust. No matter the type of relationship, building trust will have been essential to creating a sustainable and lasting bond with another human being.\n\nMost people will have been afraid of revealing their true inner sides in love. At first, the guy and the girl will have been scared to kiss, and then they\u2019ll have been scared to go to second base, and then to the third. Once they get past that, life will have gotten a bit manageable and both of you will have started to open up with each other.\n\nOnce you will have learned how to build trust in a relationship, the relationship will have entered the next little stage and will have become much happier and relaxed. Take the time to understand what your partner is looking for in a relationship and make sure your needs and feelings are expressed. When you begin there, building trust will have become much easier. To help you take the next step, in this post \u201chow to build long lasting trust in your partner\u201d, I will write on some ways that will have definitely helped you build a long lasting trust in your partner.", "original_index": 1559}, {"original": "Quickly going from:\n\n&gt;an opinion so ambiguous it is impossible to argue against \n\naka you're just looking to argue. \n\n\n..to:\n\n&gt;Of course I'm here to discuss things\n\nMoonwalk, baby! \ud83c\udf19\ud83d\udeb6\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "future_perfect_continuous_passive": "Sure, here's the rewritten text in the future perfect continuous tense:\n\n&gt;Of course I'm here to discuss things\n\nMoonwalk, baby! \ud83c\udf19\ud83d\udeb6\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "original_index": 1059}, {"original": "I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

I could feel my hole being stretched wide and I fought my reaction to get up and leave, as I needed my car. He would fuck me and then hopefully my debt would be paid. I now felt his cock head at my opening and he started to push it into my anal hole. It was starting to enter as it made its way with the help of the grease.

He grabbed a hand full of my hair pulling my head back. \"Come on boy work with me. \"\"Fuck my cock with that cute tight hole of yours. \"I began to push back against his cock's advance both in and out of me.

I was being turned on and now wanted to be fucked, as I worked with him both pushing my buttocks back and rocking myself in his hand.

I was now his bitch and he was mating me. I could feel his rhythm intensify as he pumped me like the slut I had become. My cock was so fucking hard and I wanted to cum so bad.

He continued to pound my opening hard shooting more and more cum into meMy own cock twitched and in an instant it too exploded shooting cum onto the pillow of the bed. It kept shooting and shooting as he shot every last drop he could express into me. I screamed with pleasure as I too started to complete my orgasm as the last of both our loads now came from each of our cocks until I slumped forward onto the bed with him still inside me. I felt his cock soften and I now lay exhausted as he removed his cock from my hole. It was now at my face as he told me to lick it off.

It amazed me the amount of scrutiny the regulators placed on financial propriety. Before I'd arrived, I had completed several financial disclosure forms. Where did I get the money for my Mustang? Did I work in <Organization> School? For whom & how much was I paid. Would I be working in College? If so, for whom. Man these guys wanted to know everything but my jock size. They really had a fit when I indicated I would be living off campus. They even made <Person> complete some documents and confirm her income. Thankfully, prior to the start of school, I'd arranged a job through my <Organization> coordinator, <Person>. When I first met <Person>, I was only told he was a wealthy school supporter and owned several businesses. At our first lunch meeting, I stressed to him the need to be on the up and up as I did not want to risk my eligibility. He told me not to worry; part of his responsibility was to ensure I stayed eligible but at the same time did not suffer financially. He suggested he could find a job for a family member who could then provide me with an allowance. I noted I had a job which would fund most of my expenses; but I thought it might be a good idea for <Person> to have a job to occupy her time. I mentioned she was my recently divorced Mom; young and fresh for her age; great attitude; and I wanted to keep working on improving her self esteem. Without going into details, I mentioned the divorce was the result of an abusive Dad. <Person> mentioned he might have a position for her in one of his businesses and invited me to bring her to his house that Saturday for a barbecue. I agreed and he gave me directions to his home which was out in the country. We arrived at his house that Saturday around 2:00. It was out in the country with no other house in site. As we pulled into the driveway, I noticed the lack of other guest cars. But that thought quickly left my mind as I walked around the car to open the door for <Person>. As I assisted her in alighting from the car, I cautioned her not to embarrass me or disobey. She asked how she could be disobedient to her Master. As you guessed, <Person> is a submissive & my property. For those who have forgotten, <Person> is 34 years of age. 5'2\" tall and about 105 pounds.

Seeing her perky titties, I could understand that. She escorted us through the house and out to the rear yard with patio and swimming pool. <Person> was engaged in a conversation with 3 other black dudes; all were wearing skimpy speedo bikinis. There were 5 women in addition to <Person> and <Person>. Like <Person>, they were all wearing thong bikinis and some jewelry. Nothing was on up top. <Person> escorted us to <Person> who turned and introduced himself to <Person> with a handshake and kiss on the lips. As expected, she responded. <Person>, I said, this is my friend <Person>. Thanks for inviting us out here. Great place with lots of privacy. <Person> suggested we be comfortable. I turned to <Person> and told her to remove her dress so the others would not be uncomfortable. As she shed it, I noticed <Person>'s male friends liked what they saw. I told <Person> to make herself useful as <Person> and I withdrew to have a private conversation. I can put her to work this week. He noted she appeared to have a great attitude; but was concerned about how she would act in his topless bar. It catered to Blacks and she would be one of the few white dancers.
