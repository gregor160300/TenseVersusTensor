It also includes part of the opus-100 dataset. No specific license information is available for this dataset. However the original paper can be cited like this:

and the OPUS project like this:

```

And part of the dair-ai/emotion dataset. Again no specific license is available, but the paper can be cited like this:

    pages = "3687--3697",
    abstract = "Emotions are expressed in nuanced ways, which varies by collective or individual experiences, knowledge, and beliefs. Therefore, to understand emotion, as conveyed through text, a robust mechanism capable of capturing and modeling different linguistic nuances and phenomena is needed. We propose a semi-supervised, graph-based algorithm to produce rich structural descriptors which serve as the building blocks for constructing contextualized affect representations from text. The pattern-based representations are further enriched with word embeddings and evaluated through several emotion recognition tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on emotion recognition tasks.",
